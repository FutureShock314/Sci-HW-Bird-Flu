                <h2 class="section-title">What on Earth are Birds?</h2>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Birds are many things. They are most commonly described (by
                    me at least [I'm kidding I'm a nerd]) as 'those annoying
                    flying things that poo on your head and fly around and wake
                    you up and all that lark'. This is a very bad definition.
                    For most people it's fine, but there are plenty ways of
                    improving it. For example, if you're one of those true
                    nerds, you may know that whole classification system thing
                    with kingdoms and phylums and classes and things. If you
                    want that information, youre in luck, because I was told to
                    put it here! Birds are in the kindgom of Animalia, the
                    phylum of Chordata, and the class of Aves. And I'm not
                    explaining that so I hope you know what it means. Anyway, I
                    was also told to say what's special about being part of
                    class Aves, and that just so happens to be that the
                    forelimbs are instead modified into wings! this means birds
                    don't have arms, but instead long things that let them
                    glide! This is so badly organised I have to fix this at some
                    point. Birds' navigation skills are incredible, similar to
                    how we use compasses, but in their heads (or at least
                    scientists think)! This means they have a way of sensing the
                    magnetic field of the planet and are able to use that to
                    travel and know where they're going. Back to bird flu, or
                    avian influenza, I'm fairly certain every type of bird can
                    get it, but some don't show symptoms. Anyway, this is it for
                    the informal part of this homework, so have fun reading the
                    rest of this <span class="magic-text">formal rubbish</span>

                                work on viral infections.

                <!-- <h2 class="section-subtitle">(of birds of course)</h2> -->
                <p class="section-text">
                    (Well, infection anyway.) Identifying bird flu is obviously
                    the first step in fighting it, <span class="magic-text">except not getting it in the
                    first place</span>, so it's important to know the symptoms. Symtoms
                    of bird flue include: swollen heads, a blue colouration of
                    the comb and wattles, dullness, lack of appetite,
                    respiratory distress, diarrhoea and significant drop in egg
                    production. Aside from noticing these, the best defense
                    against flu is to <span class="magic-text">not get it</span>. This can be done by following
                    some <span class="magic-text">simple steps:</span> keep birds in safe/fenced areas, keep
                    your birds from contact with wild birds, and keep food in
                    secure areas. However, <span class="magic-text">bird flu isn't exclusive to birds</span> (I
                    know, right?). It can also be transmitted to cats, dogs, and
                    other pets. It can be gained through eating of a bird with
                    the disease, or coming into contact with said bird with said
                    disease. <span class="magic-text">It can also infect humans</span>, but only very
                    occasionally. Symptoms range from a mild flu like illness,
                    sometimes with conjunctivitis (red, sore, discharging eyes),
                    diarrhoea and abdominal pain, to a severe respiratory
                    illness with breathing difficulties and pneumonia.
